### How to use

Currently, the mod does not have any functionality to upload results to a remote server.
Thus, all data collected is stored under `.minecraft/wynnsource` folder.

#### Lootrun & Raid Reward Pool scraping

- Open the lootrun or raid reward pool screen
- View all pages you need (use the refresh key to cycle through other locations' rewards).
- The output file will consist of all the items you have seen (currently filtered for nori.fish).
